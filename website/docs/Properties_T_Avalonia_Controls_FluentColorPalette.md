<td><a href="P_Avalonia_Controls_FluentColorPalette_ColorCount">ColorCount</a></td>
<td>Gets the total number of colors in this palette. A color is not necessarily a single value and may be composed of several shades. This has little meaning in this palette as colors are not strictly separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="P_Avalonia_Controls_FluentColorPalette_ShadeCount">ShadeCount</a></td>
<td>Gets the total number of shades for each color in this palette. Shades are usually a variation of the color lightening or darkening it. This has little meaning in this palette as colors are not strictly separated by shade.</td>
